# Expert-system-for-assesing-general-knowledge-of-a-student-using-snakes-and-ladders
The objective of the project is to know the effectiveness of snake and ladder board games in assessing the General Knowledge of the students. Snake and ladder game mainly depends on the luck and is played by everyone as everyone are confident about their luck. Here we modify it as expert system for assessing general knowledge of a student using snake and ladder game. Here the players winning probability is based on both luck and his/her knowledge and intelligence. In our game there are two players in which one player is the user and the other one is computer. The rules are common when compared to ancient snake and ladder game except some additional rules that apply only to the player. By this project we assess the general knowledge of the student and also asses the learning ability of the student and grade them accordingly
